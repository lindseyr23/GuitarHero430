### LED Game Display Setup Guide
<img src="./images/game_led_display.jpg" alt="LED Game Display" width="25%"/>

#### Components Needed:
- SK9822 LED strips
- Jumper wires (male-to-female)
- Enameled wire
- Heat shrink tubing
- Electrical Tape

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the LED Strip:**
   - Cut five 7-LED long strips from the SK9822 LED strip.
   
2. **Solder Jumper Wires:**
   - For only ONE LED strip, solder four jumper wires to one end:
     - G (Ground)
     - C (Clock)
     - D (Data)
     - 5V (Power)
   
3. **Attach Female Connectors:**
   - Solder female connectors to the other end of the jumper wires for this LED strip.

4. **Connect LED Strips:**
   - For the remaining four strips, connect each strip to the previous one using enameled wire:
     - Connect G to G, C to C, D to D, and 5V to 5V.
     - Hide the enameled wire connections behind the LED strips.
     - Daisy-chain the five LED strips together, ending with the jumper wires side.


5. **Secure Connections:**
   - Use electrical tape to secure the enameled wire connections behind the LED-facing side of the LED strips, forming a 5x7 LED rectangular shape.
   - Use heat shrink tubing to insulate and secure the jumper wire soldered connections.

### LED User Display Setup Guide
<img src="./images/user_led_display.jpg" alt="LED User Display" width="25%"/>


#### Components Needed:
- SK9822 LED strips
- Jumper wires (male-to-female)
- Heat shrink tubing

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the LED Strip:**
   - Cut a 5 LED long strip from the SK9822 LED strip.
   
2. **Solder Jumper Wires:**
   - Solder four jumper wires to one end of the LED strip:
     - One wire for G (Ground)
     - One wire for C (Clock)
     - One wire for D (Data)
     - One wire for 5V (Power)
   
3. **Attach Female Connectors:**
   - Solder female connectors to the other end of the jumper wires.
   
4. **Secure Connections:**
   - Use heat shrink tubing to insulate and secure the soldered connections.

#### Usage:
- Connect the female connectors to the corresponding male connectors on your control board or microcontroller.

#### Notes:
- Handle the soldering iron and heat shrink tubing carefully to prevent injuries or damage to components.
